Here you will find a collection of fun Ruby exercises that I completed at Wyncode Academy! 

They include: 
- **Ruby Pyramid** : Submit an integer through the terminal to create a pyramid made of asterisks. 
- **FizzBuzz** : A method that prints fizz for multiples of 3, buzz for multiples of 5, and fizzbuzz for multiples of both numbers!
- **People Rioting** : A class of people who can sing and riot!

### Installation 

 No installation required. Just download the **ruby-exercises.rb** file.

After downloading the file, run it from your Command Line using the following.
You will need to provide an integer for the pyramid through the terminal. 

```bash

ruby ruby-exercises.rb 5
